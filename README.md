Following Algorithms have been included:
1) Linear Regression in 2 variables
2) Multi Linear Regression
3) Logistic Regression
4) Naive Bayes
5) PCA
6) K Means
7) Neural Networks
8) Decision Tree
9) Support Vector Machine
10) R2 Score and Metrics

### Note SKLearn is used from testing the code and datesets.
